I got a Bachelor’s degree from the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/), and my 
Master’s degree from the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/). Currently, 
I work as a Software Engineer at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/teams/aft) Berlin.

During my studies, I gained a lot of interest in algorithms and data structures, as well as 
distributed systems, databases, and search engines. I explored those topics with my master’s 
thesis on [graph compression](https://github.com/tomfran/ANS-Graph-compression), and with side 
projects on [LSM tree](https://github.com/tomfran/LSM-Tree) and [search engine](https://github.com/tomfran/search-rs) 
implementations.

I had the opportunity of being a contestant at [SWERC](https://swerc.eu/), a team competitive 
programming competition, in 2020 and 2022, also, I liked to participate in 
[Google Hashcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_Code_(programming_competition)) every time 
I got the chance.

In my free time, I like to practice calisthenics and improve my cooking. I also [read](/library) 
occasionally but not as much as I should.
